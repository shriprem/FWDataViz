The keyboard shortcuts associated with menu items provide a quick way to invoke frequently used actions, without shifting focus away from the document to access the plugin panel buttons.

* **Field Hop actions**: The default shortcuts are `ALT + Left Arrow` and `ALT + Right Arrow`. They have been chosen for their similarity with the `CTRL + Left Arrow` and `CTRL + Right Arrow` shortcuts for word navigation in most text editors.

* **Field Copy & Field Paste actions**: The default shortcuts are `ALT + , (comma)` and `ALT + . (period)`. At least on the US keyboards, the `, (comma)` key also functions as the `<` key, and the `. (period)` key as the `>` key. To better remember these shortcuts, it may help to associate the directions of the `<` and `>` keys as mnemonics with the copy and paste operations.

* To redefine the menu item keyboard shortcuts to your preference, use the _Shortcut mapper_ dialog in Notepad++. Access via Notepad++ menu: _Settings » Shortcut Mapper..., Plugin Commands_ tab.
