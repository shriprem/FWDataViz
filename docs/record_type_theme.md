## Record Type - Theme
The Record Type - Theme feature allows you to specify a different color theme than the file-type theme for select-few record types to make them distinctive.

Specify a distinctive theme such as _Dark Energy_, _Lunar_, or _Martian_ for record types that function as demarcators or section headers within a fixed-width data file.

In the example clip below, the 'Transaction Headers' are being visualized with the _Lunar_ theme. This is a sample file that can be viewed within the FWDataViz plugin (_View Sample Files_ » _Sample Multiple-Record-Type Files_ » _Treasury IPAC File_).

**Limitation**:
The cumulative total count of styles from all themes used for a file type must not exceed 200. Themes & styles beyond this count will be ignored.
