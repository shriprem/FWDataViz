### Version 2.6.1.0 [August 2, 2022]

#### Major Enhancements
1. [Fold Structures Editor](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/fold_structs_editor.md)

#### Minor Enhancements
1. [_Plugin Panel_] Selecting `-` as the _File Type_ will clear the fixed-width data visualization.
2. [_Plugin Panel_] If the plugin is unable to find a match for the fixed-width file type in the user-customized `Visualizer.ini` file, it will attempt to find a match in the `default_Visualizer.ini` file. Thus sample files will render with fixed-width data visualization across Notepad++ sessions even if their fixed-width metadata has been removed from the user-customized `Visualizer.ini` file.
3. [_Plugin Panel_] Clicking the `â€¦` button at the right-bottom corner of the plugin panel will display the refreshed list of file paths for the INI files active for the current fixed-width file. Just hovering over this button will display the last refreshed list.

#### Known Issues
1. If you use Notepad++ menu options to fold levels, the text in the view page may end up partially colorized. However, if you move the caret (i.e., keyboard cursor) to a different position, the page will be fully colorized again. You can avoid this by using the **Fold** and **Unfold** buttons on the _FWDataViz_ side panel.
2. If you edit the data file, you may also need to click on the **Apply** button on the _FWDataViz_ side panel to rescan the file and rebuild the new folding structure. No workaround for this, since any file edits may require a full file scan which will not be optimal if done automatically for each bit of file edit.

**Release:** [2.6.1.0 Release](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/releases/tag/v2.6.1.0)

---

### Version 2.6.0.0 [July 11, 2022]

#### Major Enhancements
1. Foldable Record Blocks.
2. [_Plugin Panel_] **Default Background** checkbox option to suppress the background colors specified in theme styles.
3. [_Side Panel_] **Show Calltip** checkbox option to display inline **Cursor Position Data**.

#### Minor Enhancements
1. [_Plugin Panel_] **Fold** and **Unfold** buttons for: _All Levels_ and _Level 1_ to _Level 10_. These buttons are functional with any file (fixed-width or not) opened in Notepad++.
2. [_Plugin Panel_] **Toggle Line** button to toggle between folded and unfolded states on the current line. This button is functional with any file (fixed-width or not) opened in Notepad++.
3. [_Jump to Field popup_] Checkbox option to prefix sequence numbers to field names in the _Select Fields_ dropdown list.
4. [_Preferences Dialog_] Specify color and transparency for the horizontal demarcator lines drawn above and below the fold header text-line when the block it encloses is in collapsed state. This preference setting is applied globally for all files open in Notepad++.

**Release:** [2.6.0.0 Release](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/releases/tag/v2.6.0.0)

---

### Version 2.5.3.0 [June 11, 2022]

1. Enhanced Darkmode support.

**Release:** [2.5.3.0 Release](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/releases/tag/v2.5.3.0)

---

### Version 2.5.2.0 [June 4, 2022]

1. Fixed: Manually set selections of _**File Type**_ and _**Visualizer Theme**_ are being lost when returning to the same document after briefly switching to a different document in Notepad++. This issue started in the _FWDataViz_ plugin with the Notepad++ 8.4 version. See issue: [#61](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/issues/61).

2. Fixed: Crashing when scrolling beyond the last line. See issue: [#58](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/issues/58).

3. Fixed: Crashing when clicking the Plus or Minus buttons on the filled line items after a Data Extraction. See issue: [#60](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/issues/60).

4. Including 3 new Visualizer Themes: **_Tango Light, Tango Dark, Tango Stripes_**. Shared by @trybowski.

5. The *SPACE* & _BLANK_ fields in the Sample Data files have been tagged with _DEFAULT_STYLE_ to better illustrate the default styling feature that was added in _FWDataViz_ [version 2.5.1.0](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/releases/tag/v2.5.1.0).

**Release:** [2.5.2.0 Release](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/releases/tag/v2.5.2.0)

---

### Version 2.5.1.0 [May 29, 2022]

1. Fields tagged with an undefined field type such as _NO_STYLING_ or _DEFAULT_STYLE_ or _STYLE_DEFAULT_ will be rendered with the default background and foreground colors of the currently **Selected Theme** in Notepad++'s **Style Configurator**. For more info, see: [Field Types - Default Style](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/field_type_dialog.md#default-style).

2. With the built-in support for *Framed Current Line* in Notepad++ 8.4.1, the *Framed Current Line* checkbox control has been permanently removed from the *FWDataViz* plugin panel and menu.

3. With Notepad++ 8.4.2, plugins now have query support for Darkmode. By utilizing this support, the Darkmode render code in the _FWDataViz_ plugin has been significantly trimmed down. This has resulted in a smaller size of the plugin DLL for this version.

### Known Issues
#### 1. _CSVLint_ plugin
Starting with Notepad++ v8.4.1, if you have both the _FWDataViz_ and _CSVLint_ plugins installed and then open a CSV file while the _FWDataViz_ side panel is open, Notepad++ will crash.

This issue got introduced when the _CSVLint_ plugin made code changes to comply with the Scintilla Lexer upgrade of Notepad++ 8.4. (_FWDataViz_ was not affected by the Scintilla lexer upgrade since it uses Scintilla _**styles**_ instead of the Scintilla _**lexer**_). To resolve this, two issues ([#25](https://github.com/BdR76/CSVLint/issues/25) and [#26](https://github.com/BdR76/CSVLint/issues/26)) have been opened at the _CSVLint_ repository. The issue has been fixed in [CSVLint 0.4.5.2 release](https://github.com/BdR76/CSVLint/releases/tag/0.4.5.2).

As a workaround, if you have the _CSVLint_ plugin installed, close the _FWDataViz_ side panel before opening any CSV files. Alternatively, use the _CSVQuery_ plugin which has no such issues.

#### 2. Files with misleading extensions
When fixed-width data files happen to have a specific language extension such as `.ini`, `.xml`, `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, `.java`, `.sql`, `.cpp`, `.py`, etc. in their filenames, there will be no visualization of such files from the _FWDataViz_ plugin. This is an issue that got introduced with the Scintilla Lexer upgrade in Notepad++ 8.4 release. See this [comment](https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org/post/77180).

So, avoid having your fixed-width data files with misleading language extensions in their filenames.

**Release:** [2.5.1.0 Release](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/releases/tag/v2.5.1.0)

---

### Version 2.5.0.0 [May 7, 2022]

1. Dynamic change of Dark mode tones: When dark mode settings are changed in the Preferences dialog of Notepad++ (version 8.4.1 or higher), they will be immediately reflected in the _FwDataViz_ plugin user interfaces -- without requiring a restart of Notepad++.

2. With the built-in support for *Framed Current Line* in Notepad++ 8.4.1, the options for toggling the *Framed Current Line* from the *FWDataViz* plugin will be suppressed.

3. Fixed blurry disabled static texts in dark mode.

4. The Preferences option for *Closing plugin panel clears visualization* is now handled even when the *FWDataViz* panel is closed by clicking the 'X' button on its title bar.


**Release:** [2.5.0.0 Release](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/releases/tag/v2.5.0.0)

---

### Version 2.4.0.2 [February 4, 2022]
**Background:** With its v8.3 release, the Notepad++ *x64* binary will support opening 2GB+ files. However, this change causes compability issue with many *x64* plugins, [and they will need to be recompiled with a modified C++ header file](https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org/topic/22471/recompile-your-x64-plugins-with-new-header).

The _FWDataViz_ ***x64*** plugin was affected by this incompatibility issue specifically when trying to extract data in the [Data Extraction dialog](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/data_extract_dialog.md). With the suggested recompile of the _FWDataViz_ plugin with the modified C++ header file, the v2.4.0.2 release fixes this issue.

**Release:** [2.4.0.2 Release](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/releases/tag/v2.4.0.2)

---

### Version 2.4.0.1 [December 17, 2021]
1. Updated `NPP_Plugin_Darkmode.dll` to [version 1.1.0.0](https://github.com/shriprem/NPP_Plugin_Darkmode/releases/tag/v1.1.0.0). This fixes darkmode rendering issue in Windows 11.

**Release:** [2.4.0.1 Release](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/releases/tag/v2.4.0.1)

---

### Version 2.4.0.0 [December 2, 2021]

1. [Field Types](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/field_type_dialog.md) for distinguishing fields sharing the same traits.

2. Preferences dialog added to configure three new settings.

3. Regex expression fields are now validated for user input errors.

4. Darkmode for the _FWDataViz_ plugin is now rendered by a standalone DLL that can be shared by multiple plugins, thus reducing the overall memory footprint. Notepad++ will only load a copy of the `NPP_Plugin_Darkmode.dll` located either in:
   * The folder for the first plugin (_in alphabetical order_) that requires this DLL.
   * Or, in the common `<Notepad++_executable_folder>`.

   You can verify the singleton loading of the `NPP_Plugin_Darkmode.dll` using the [Process Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) utility.

**Plugin Developers**: For more information on using `NPP_Plugin_Darkmode.dll` in your plugins, please refer to the documentation at the [NPP_Plugin_Darkmode](https://github.com/shriprem/NPP_Plugin_Darkmode) repository.

**Release:** [2.4.0.0 Release](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/releases/tag/v2.4.0.0)

### Version 2.3.0.0 [November 11, 2021]
#### Enhancements
1. [Field Copy](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/field_copy_paste.md#field-copy) and [Field Paste](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/field_copy_paste.md#field-paste) with smart left or right alignment and padding or trimming.

2. [Hop to the left or right Edge](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/field_navigation.md) of the current field or adjacent fields.

3. [Menu Items with Keyboard Shortcuts](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/menu_shortcuts.md) to invoke frequently used actions, without shifting focus away from the document to access the plugin panel buttons.

4. [Total Support for Multi-byte Characters](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/multibyte_character_support.md). _Record Markers, Record Terminators_ and _ADFT Regexes_ can all now include multi-byte characters. Like so with _Prefix_ and _Suffix_ labels during data extraction.

**Release:** [2.3.0.0 Release](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/releases/tag/v2.3.0.0)

---

### Version 2.2.0.0 [October 19, 2021]
#### Enhancements
1. Visualize files with [Multi-byte Character Data](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/multibyte_character_data.md).

2. Use character column counts for *Field Column* values in [Cursor Position Data](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/README.md#fixed-width-data-visualizer-panel) while in [Multi-byte Character Data](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/multibyte_character_data.md) mode.

3. Display UTF-8 Bytes and Unicode value  for multi-byte characters in [Cursor Position Data](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/README.md#fixed-width-data-visualizer-panel) on the plugin panel (*regardless* of whether the multi-byte character mode is switched on or not).

4. Use character column counts in [Jump To Field](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/README.md#jump-to-field-popup) while in [Multi-byte Character Data](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/multibyte_character_data.md) mode.

5. Use character column counts in [Data Extraction](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/data_extract_dialog.md) while in [Multi-byte Character Data](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/multibyte_character_data.md) mode.

6. A [hidden option](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/multibyte_character_data.md#quick-override-from-panel) on the plugin panel to quickly override the File Type [Multi-byte Character Data](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/multibyte_character_data.md) mode.

#### Fixed
1. Record overshoots occurred with [Jump To Field](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/README.md#jump-to-field-popup) and [Data Extraction](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/data_extract_dialog.md) when record terminated earlier than at their full defined lengths.

**Release:** [2.2.0.0 Release](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/releases/tag/v2.2.0.0)

---

### Version 2.1.2.1 [September 3, 2021]
1. **Enhancement:** Cursor will be briefly set to block mode to highlight its position in text when using [Jump to Field](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz#jump-to-field-popup).

2. **Fixed:** The Cursor Position Data was refreshing only when the page was scrolled. This regression got introduced in version 2.1.0.0.

**Release:** [2.1.2.1 Release](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/releases/tag/v2.1.2.1)

---

### Version 2.1.1.1 [August 31, 2021]
1. **Fixed:** If the ADFT option had been enabled, the plugin was clearing out the NPP's lexing (color scheme) of standard file types (such as .xml, .cpp, .js, etc.). The workaround was to close the FWDataViz panel, and restart NPP. Not anymore with this release.

2. **Minor Change:** After the File Types or Themes Configuration were edited and saved, a backup file was created using the [MoveFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-movefile) Windows API  to move the *Visualizer.ini* or *Themes.ini* into the *Backup* folder, and the changes were saved to a new file to replace the original config file. With this release, the backup is created instead by using the [CopyFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-copyfile) Windows API. This will allow the usage of hardlinks, if needed for some users, to these config files.

**Release:** [2.1.1.1 Release](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/releases/tag/v2.1.1.1)

---

### Version 2.1.1.0 [August 29, 2021]
1. **Change:** Themes configuration file extension has been changed from *.dat* to *.ini*. During the initial load, the plugin will rename *Themes.dat* file to *Themes.ini*, if and only if the latter is not already existing in the plugin config folder. See the feature request [issue](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/issues/27).

2. **Change:** In Darkmode, the dropdown arrow for comboboxes has been changed from [U+02C5 (MODIFIER LETTER DOWN ARROWHEAD)](https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/02C5/index.htm) to [U+25BF (WHITE DOWN-POINTING SMALL TRIANGLE)](https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/25bf/index.htm).

3. **Fixed:** In some instances, the File Open dialog was not launching at the FWDataViz Config Backup folder when either the _Load Backup Configuration_ (in the [File Type Metadata Editor](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/file_type_config_dialog.md)) or the _Load Backup Themes File_ (in the [Visualizer Theme Editor](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/theme_config_dialog.md)) buttons were clicked.

4. **Optimized:** All three ICD-10 Sample Files were edited to retain only the first and last 10,000 lines (for a total 20,000 lines) from their original versions. This will yield around 30% reduction in this plugin's binary packages.

**Release:** [2.1.1.0 Release](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/releases/tag/v2.1.1.0)

---

### Version 2.1.0.0 [August 23, 2021]
1. **Enhancement:** FWDataViz is now able to visualize even when wordwrap is enabled for a document. Hence the "Turnoff Wordwrap" button on the panel became redundant, and so has been removed.
2. **Fixed:** FWDataviz was not visualizing all lines in view when block(s) of lines were folded or hidden (the latter, via NPP menu: *View Â» Hide Lines*). See: [issue #25](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/issues/25).

**Release:** [Wordwrap, Fold Lines & Hide Lines Release](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/releases/tag/v2.1.0.0)

---

### Version 2.0.0.0 [August 18, 2021]
#### Enhancements:
1. Darkmode rendering enabled for the plugin panel and dialog boxes.
2. Toolbar icons in filled and unfilled modes.

#### `NOTE`
Notepad++ user configuration settings are saved into the config.xml file by Notepad++ only during the application closing event. The FWDataViz plugin is only able to read these settings changes in the config.xml file during the next launch of Notepad++.

So, when Darkmode and toolbar icon settings are changed, Notepad++ will need to be restarted for the plugin to reflect these settings changes.

See: [Sample screenshots of the plugin UI in dark mode](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/dark_mode_ui.md)

**Release:** [Dark mode Plugin UI Release](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/releases/tag/v2.0.0.0)

---

### Version 1.4.2.0 [July 13, 2021]
#### Enhancements:
1. Page mode added to [Data Extraction](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/data_extract_dialog.md) dialog. The dialog now supports up to 30 line items, 10 line items per page across 3 pages.
---
### Version 1.4.0.1 [July 9, 2021]
#### Enhancements:
1. [Easy Keyboard Navigation](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/data_extract_key_shortcuts.md) in the Data Extraction dialog.

---

### Version 1.4.0.0 [July 6, 2021]
#### Enhancements:
1. [Data Extraction](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/data_extract_dialog.md) feature to extract a handful data fields into an easily readable, quick report.

---

### Version 1.0.3.1 [June 18, 2021]
#### Enhancements:
1. Light & Dark mode Fluent UI toolbar icons added for the plugin.
2. Including ARM64 build. (_Please note that I am unable to test the ARM64 build since I don't have an ARM64 device, and it is being provided AS IS._)

##### _`ALERT!` This plugin release is only compatible with Notepad++ 8.0 and later releases._

#### Programming Note:
The Notepad++ 8.0 has introduced the Fluent UI icons in Small/Large, Light/Dark & Unfilled/Filled modes, making for a total of 8 possible combinations. But the newly added API function [`NPPM_ADDTOOLBARICON_FORDARKMODE`](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/commit/8a898bae3f84c03c44aaed25001e9fa1ddfa09aa) has allowed the plugins to supply images for only 4 Fluent UI images among the possible set of 8.

Due to the current NPP API limitation, this minor release for FWDataViz is only able to add Fluent UI icons for the Small/Large, Light/Dark Fluent UI modes but not the Filled/Unfilled Fluent UI modes. So the toolbar icons for this plugin will not change when switching between unfilled and filled Fluent UI selections in Notepad++ Preferences dialog.

---

### Version 1.0.3.0 [April 15, 2021]
#### Enhancements:
1. [Record Type Themes](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/record_type_theme.md)

---

### Version 1.0.2.0 [April 7, 2021]
#### Enhancements:
1. [Automatic Detection of File Types](https://github.com/shriprem/FWDataViz/blob/master/docs/auto_detect_file_type.md)

---

### Version 1.0.1.0 [March 10, 2021]
#### Enhancements:
1. *Cursor Position Data* display will shrink or grow to the dock panel width.
2. Long text in *Cursor Position Data* display will scroll horizontally instead of wrapping to the next line.
3. Added *Record Length [Current/Defined]* line in *Cursor Position Data* display.

---

### Version 1.0.0.0 [January 13, 2021]

Initial Release
